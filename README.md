Assuming that we are still within the Movement Control Order and you are requested to propose a time-tabling system for a law firm. Create a made-up (but believable) company that consists of more than 20 employees. You will need to do some background study on law firms structural organisation and proposed one for your made-up company. The time-tabling system must adhere to the attach standard of procedures (SOP) document, as well as to the following requirements:
• Staff will be categorized into three groups, red, yellow, green. The red group are those required to be quarantined, yellow – showing feverish symptom and green – healthy.
• Only greed staff can go to the office. Yellow staff must continue to work from home (WFH). Red staff are on quarantine leaves.
• Sick staff required to report their condition (from green category to yellow and vice versa) three days prior to coming to the office.
• The priority of scheduling is given to those handling urgent cases or cases that are active for the current month.
• The system will strive to be fair on the number of days each staff is required to be at the office.
• Green staff can still WFH given certain constraints and having consent from their superior.

Your proposal must consist of a brief introduction about the company, its organizational chart and any extra requirements that you think needed. As for the system, design the entity-relationship diagram using the ER Assistant and attach it in the proposal.
